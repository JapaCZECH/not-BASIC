# Version 1.0 finally done!
I wanted to procrastinate so much, but I did it!
## ------------------
Not-BASIC was made fully in python. It can run all of the file extensions, so yes, if you have a file with .cpp extension, but with nbsc code, it fully executes!
### Credits
BIIIIIIIIG thank you for CodePulse on youtube. Without him this wouldn't be possible. Also some things in code are from him (a lot).
